# Deployment Recap: What Actually Happened

## Overview
The deployment script created a **locally-managed** Cloudflare Tunnel, but didn't properly configure public access when using domains not owned in Cloudflare (like `.pages.dev` or domains not added to your account).

## What the Script Did

### 1. **Created a Locally-Managed Tunnel**
- Generated a tunnel secret locally
- Created tunnel via API with this secret
- Stored credentials in `/etc/cloudflared/`
- This creates a tunnel that's managed by the local config file

### 2. **Failed to Configure Public Hostname**
- Attempted to configure ingress with a `.pages.dev` domain
- This failed because `.pages.dev` domains can't be used for tunnels
- Left the tunnel without any public hostname

### 3. **Started the Tunnel Service**
- Tunnel was running but not accessible from the internet
- No public URL was configured

## What You Had to Do Manually

### 1. **Transfer to Remote Management**
- In Cloudflare Dashboard → Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels
- Found your tunnel and clicked "Configure"
- Had to transfer from local to remote management
- This allows configuration through the dashboard

### 2. **Add Public Hostname**
- Clicked "Public Hostname" tab
- Added your domain (kaloris.cc)
- Configured service as HTTP → localhost:8000

### 3. **Fix the Application**
- The app was crashing due to extra fields in `.env`
- Had to update `config.py` to ignore extra fields

## Why This Happened

1. **Locally vs Remotely Managed Tunnels**
   - **Locally-managed**: Configuration stored on server, harder to modify
   - **Remotely-managed**: Configuration in Cloudflare, easy to modify via dashboard

2. **Domain Validation**
   - Script didn't validate if the domain was actually available
   - `.pages.dev` domains don't work with tunnels

3. **Missing Public Hostname**
   - Script tried to configure hostname with invalid domain
   - Failed silently, leaving tunnel without public access

## Better Approach

### Option 1: Create Remotely-Managed Tunnels
- Don't provide `tunnel_secret` when creating
- Configure everything through dashboard
- Easier to manage and modify

### Option 2: Validate Domains First
- Check if domain exists in Cloudflare account
- Only configure hostname if domain is valid
- Provide clear instructions for manual setup if needed

### Option 3: Skip Hostname Configuration
- Create tunnel without public hostname
- Always require manual configuration in dashboard
- Clearer and more predictable
