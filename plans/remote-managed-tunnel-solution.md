# Solution: Support Remotely-Managed Tunnels

## Current Behavior (Locally-Managed)
The script creates locally-managed tunnels by:
1. Generating a `tunnel_secret`
2. Creating tunnel with this secret
3. Storing credentials locally
4. Running cloudflared with local config

## Better Approach (Remotely-Managed)
To create remotely-managed tunnels:
1. DON'T provide `tunnel_secret` in API call
2. Get a tunnel token from the API response
3. Run cloudflared with the token (not config file)

## API Changes Needed

### Current (Locally-Managed):
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/tunnels" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"name\":\"${TUNNEL_NAME}\",\"tunnel_secret\":\"${TUNNEL_SECRET}\"}"
```

### New (Remotely-Managed):
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/tunnels" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"name\":\"${TUNNEL_NAME}\",\"config_src\":\"cloudflare\"}"
```

## Running Cloudflared

### Current (Locally-Managed):
```bash
cloudflared --config /etc/cloudflared/config.yml tunnel run
```

### New (Remotely-Managed):
```bash
cloudflared tunnel run --token ${TUNNEL_TOKEN}
```

## Benefits of Remotely-Managed
1. ✅ Configure everything in dashboard
2. ✅ No migration needed
3. ✅ Easier to modify routes
4. ✅ Better for teams
5. ✅ Cleaner deployment

## Script Modification Options

### Option 1: Always Remote-Managed
- Simplest approach
- Always requires dashboard configuration
- Most user-friendly

### Option 2: Add --remote Flag
- Default to remote-managed
- Allow --local flag for advanced users
- Best of both worlds

### Option 3: Auto-Configure if Domain Valid
- Check if domain exists in account
- If yes: create with public hostname
- If no: create remote-managed for manual config
